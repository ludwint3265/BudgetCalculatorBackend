Plan your meals for the week, buy in-season produce and affordable protein sources like beans, lentils, or chicken. Cook in larger batches and freeze leftovers to reduce waste and save time.\n\n2.  **Strategic Eating Out:** Set aside a smaller portion of your budget (e.g., \\$75) for eating out. Look for lunch specials, happy hour deals, or early bird discounts. Consider ordering appetizers or sharing entrees to save money. Limit eating out to once or twice a week.\n\n3.  **Embrace Budget-Friendly Options:** The final portion of your budget (e.g., \\$25) is for inexpensive food items. Shop at discount grocery stores, use coupons and cashback apps, and take advantage of loyalty programs to save money on food.\n\n"}
